# Modeling complex biological systems and using evolutionary algorithms to learn their parameters from heterogenous data

## Introduction  
Our overarching goal here is two-fold:  
1. Mathematically and computationally model the dynamics of complex biological systems. Here we will achieve this with ordinary differential equations.
2. Learn unknown or unmeasurable parameters from highly heterogenous datasets. Here we will achieve this with genetic or evolutionary algorithms (EA).

## Jupyter notebook tutorials:  
The following notebooks will take you from zero through the two overarching goals described above:  
1. [Very simple three cell system](https://github.com/jeffmsnell/modelingEA/blob/master/201611_Nov_negnegfb.ipynb)  
2. More complex three cell system
